## Overview

**CFLAP**, standing for *Collaborative Formal Language and Automata Package*, is a remake of *JFLAP*, a software tool for experimenting with formal languages and automata theory. The software was made to be used in the MINIX operating system.

## Features

- **Automata:** The software allows the user to create and simulate finite automata.
- **Collaboration:** The software allows two users to collaborate on the same automaton.

## Technologies

- **Programming Languages:** C
