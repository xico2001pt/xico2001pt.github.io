## Overview

This project aimed to develop an AI agent capable of learning to park a vehicle in a vertical parking spot using Reinforcement Learning. The agent was trained in a simulated environment using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm and the Unity ML-Agents toolkit.

## Features

- **AI Parking Agent:** The agent learns to park a vehicle in a vertical parking spot.
- **Reinforcement Learning:** The agent is trained using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm.
- **Unity ML-Agents:** The agent is developed using the Unity ML-Agents toolkit.

## Technologies

- **Programming Languages:** C#
- **Libraries:** Unity ML-Agents
- **Tools:** Unity
