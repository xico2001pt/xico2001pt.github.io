## Overview

This work consisted in developing a simulation model to analyze the distribution of charging stations for electric vehicles (EVs) in Porto, considering the city's urban dynamics and the distinctive charging dynamics of EVs. The main goal was to provide valuable insights for optimizing infrastructure in alignment with urban dynamics.

## Features

- **Charging Stations Distribution:** The model simulates the distribution of charging stations in Porto.
- **Urban Dynamics:** The model considers the city's urban dynamics to optimize the distribution.
- **Charging Dynamics:** The model considers the distinctive charging dynamics of EVs.
- **Graphical Interface:** The simulation model features a user-friendly graphical interface.

## Technologies

- **Programming Languages:** Python
- **Libraries:** Mesa, GeoPy
- **Tools:** QGIS (extract data)
