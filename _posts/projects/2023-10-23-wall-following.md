## Overview

This project aimed to develop a reactive wall-following robot capable of navigating autonomously in a question-mark-shaped environment. The robot was equipped with LIDAR sensors to detect obstacles and used a reactive control strategy to follow the wall.

## Features

- **Reactive Wall Following:** The robot navigates autonomously in a question-mark-shaped environment.
- **LIDAR Sensors:** The robot is equipped with LIDAR sensors to detect obstacles.
- **Reactive Control Strategy:** The robot uses a reactive control strategy to follow the wall.

## Technologies

- **Programming Languages:** Python
- **Libraries:** ROS
- **Tools:** Gazebo
