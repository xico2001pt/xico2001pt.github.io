## Overview

**Mobile Car Driving** is an Android application that provides driver assistance via computer vision developed using *Pytorch* (Mobile). The main challenge involved creating a model that was both performant enough to be capable of running in real time and that was compatible with the limited capabilities of Pytorch Mobile.

## Features

- **Real-time Detection:** The application is capable of detecting cars, pedestrians, and traffic signs in real time.
- **Object Classification:** The detected objects are classified into the aforementioned categories.
- **Warning System:** The application provides warnings to the driver when it detects a potential hazard, like proximity to another car or a pedestrian crossing the road.
- **User Interface:** The application features a user-friendly interface that displays the camera feed and the detected objects.

## Technologies

- **Programming Languages:** Python, Java
- **Libraries:** Pytorch, Android Studio
