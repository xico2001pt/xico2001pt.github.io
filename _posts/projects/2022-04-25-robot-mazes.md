## Overview

This project consists of utilizing AI techniques to solve a maze puzzle. The robot must navigate through a maze by looping through an input sequence of commands (`UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`) and reach the end of the maze. The goal is to find the shortest input sequence that solves the maze. Here is an example:

## Features

- **Maze Solver:** The robot is capable of solving mazes by following a sequence of commands.
- **Optimization:** The robot finds the shortest sequence of commands to solve the maze.
- **Visual Representation:** The maze is displayed in a graphical interface, allowing the user to visualize the robot's path.
- **User Interaction:** The user can input custom mazes and sequences of commands to test the robot's capabilities.

## Technologies

- **Programming Languages:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pygame
