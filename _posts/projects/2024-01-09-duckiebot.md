## Overview

This project aimed to develop a DuckieBot follower capable of autonomously following a DuckieBot leader. The follower robot was equipped with a camera to detect the leader, where both Computer Vision and Deep Learning techniques were used to process the images and extract the necessary information to follow the leader.

## Features

- **DuckieBot Follower:** The robot is capable of autonomously following a DuckieBot leader.
- **Camera:** The robot is equipped with a camera to detect the leader.
- **Computer Vision:** Computer Vision techniques are used to process the images and extract the necessary information.
- **Deep Learning:** Deep Learning techniques are used to improve the detection and tracking of the leader.

## Technologies

- **Programming Languages:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV, PyTorch, Duckietown
